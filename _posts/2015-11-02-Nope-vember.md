This is a post about being mindful when it comes to food. It is inspired by some of the recent news coverage on the topics of food. Now don't get me wrong, there's a lot of bullshit out there, for example:

[Lifehunters one month of not eating shitty foods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyeor3z9EdQ): Step 1: Be skinny and fit (15.5% body fat is a really good value for someone who is not an athlete). Step 2: Starve yourself and digest your own muscle mass. He lost 4.5 kg total, 1.64 kg is fat tissue, which is a 2.83 kg loss in muscle mass. In one month. Congrats idiot, you just starved away two-months-progress of intense fitness training.

[WHO realized that eating bacon on a daily basis is unhealthy](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/who-does-bacon-cause-cancer-sort-of-but-not-really/) ... by increasing the relative risk for colorectal cancer by 18 percent, raising it from 5% to 6%. If you eat bacon on a daily basis, you're gonna have some more problems than just colorectal cancer. Kudos, WHO.

## ... but ...

... still, I can't shake the feeling that there's some room for improvement in our meal plans. I am a fairly healthy individual, work out five to eight times a week (daily 5 km run, [boxing](http://www.1860boxen.de/), [swimming](http://www.maennerschwimmverein.de/index.php/masters), [fitness](http://www.fit-star.de/)), and I eat fairly well, i.e. I like to cook and I try to avoid processed food. So here's my plan for November.

## Don't:

* Absolutely no processed food or artificial ingredients: That includes sweets, chips, some fruit juices, sausages, burgers, alcohol-free wheat beer, and (much to my dismay) [Paulaner Spezi](http://www.paulaner.de/de/produkte/alkoholfreie-getraenke/spezi).
* No sugar: Espresso and tea tastes better without it, anyway.
* No high-sodium foods: Common sense is that we eat too much salt, a lot of which comes from the aforementioned processed foods. Foods loaded with unnecessary amounts of sodium will cause you to retain water. You are probably carrying a lot of fluid which you were assuming to be fat. The body only needs between 2000-2500mg of sodium a day to complete its metabolic functions. In general, I'll avoid foods like smoked, cured, salted or canned meat, salted nuts, but also the pinch of salt you eat with your breakfast egg/cucumber. I will, however, still use salt when I cook a meal, albeit in greatly reduced quantity, because Bolognese sauce without salt tastes like ass.
* No alcohol.

## Do:

* Buy local: Buying local is not only a good idea in terms of ecological footprint, but also in terms of furthering local agriculture. My vegetables are mostly from the local farmer's market, so there should not be too much of a difference here.
* Flexitarian diet: Vegan is not for me, because I personally feels it is overhyped. If you can pull it off without becoming a missionary, more power to you. But still, the human body is not made for eating meat on a daily basis, so a vegetarian diet makes a lot of sense. There's just the tiny caveat that I *really* like [a tasty steak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO-LFVHpA4s), fish or some Tartar every now and then. So I'll allow myself fish and meat once a week each. Flexitarian it is.
* High-protein foods and unsaturated fats: Greek Yoghurt, Cheese, Eggs, [Muesli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muesli), Lentils, Nuts, Tofu, Fish, Avocado, Olives, ...
* Fruits, lots of them. Duh.

This will not be one of those posts where I get a check-up before doing this, then claiming that some values have improved, giving it a pseudo-science-y feel. This will just be a report of my experience along the road. Also, this post will be updated every couple of days with recipes.
