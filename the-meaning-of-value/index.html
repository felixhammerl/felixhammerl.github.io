            <p>Quite a while ago, I stumbled across a <a href="http://thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-worst/">post by Moxie Marlinspike</a> about the value of things. Moxie argues that optimizing for the best doesn't leave room for being wrong or being stupid or new experiences. In his opinion, you'll deprive yourself of the ability to break the cycle and make mistakes that open your eyes in a whole new way. The fact that overoptimization of the self leaves you in an ivory tower of your own is pretty much universally accepted. But he also mixes up consumption and perceived value.</p>

<h2 id="getaworkhorse">Get a workhorse</h2>

<p>I really think that you always should have the best tools available if you do something, but that's what they are: Tools. Things to get shit done. If you rely on a tools, get the best tools money can buy, but maintain them well. "Best" is not necessarily the most expensive, but the most well-crafted, the most reliable, the best-suited for the task at hand. If what you're about to buy is not important to you, don't even bother cluttering up your life. There's a reason I like(d) my iPhone 4s, my Thinkpad x41, my hiking boots, my old motorcycle, etc. All of those are examples of real workhorses that help(ed) me get things done. Boots get chuffed up when you use them, my x41 flew off the desk more often than I can count, my iPhone was even thrown across the whole office (turns out spinning this thing was a bad idea when the cable does not lock), but imperfections due to use don't dimish the value of those things. If something breaks, you repair it and get on with it. Another thing is carelessness, where you don't clean your shoes or apply regular care after use, where you don't get your your car's oil changed every now and then, where you don't even buy a $5 rain cover for your motorcycle that stands outside in the rain.</p>

<p>Think about it in terms of Terry Pratchet's boots analogy: You can either have $50 boots, that are well-made and -- given regular maintenance, cleaning and a set of new soles -- will last longer than multiple sets of cheaper boots, which ironically will cost you more in the end but still are not to your satisfaction. There's a turkish proverb saying: "I can't afford to buy cheap things".</p>

<h2 id="youdontswapacarenginewithaleathermanmultitool">You don't swap a car engine with a leatherman multitool</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that well-made stuff is not always the most expensive. You need stuff to get something done, that don't mean your boots need to be the most exclusive leather from a super rare species found in northeast Siberia. It doesn't have to come with all the bells and whistles. If something does a thousand things, you can be sure it does those things worse than specialized tools, one for each of the thousand tasks: You don't swap a car engine with a leatherman multitool.</p>

<h2 id="afewthingswhereicantaffordtobuycheaplymadestuff">A few things where I can't afford to buy cheaply made stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li>Smartphones: I spend so much time with these devices, them not working makes me angry. Nexus, iPhone, or nothing. Life's too short for Samsung.</li>
<li>Laptops: My everyday work tool, so for me it's unix-oid OS and good hardware. Macbook, Thinkpad, or Toshiba Portege.</li>
<li>Shoes/boots: You need good boots. No way around that. Don't get stranded on a mountain with your soles falling off.</li>
<li>Suits: Good wool doesn't crinkle or smell, even after extended use.</li>
<li>Furniture: Good furniture is made of solid wood instead of chipboard, it will survive more than one assemly, and it can stay with you for the next fifteen years. But no, it is generally not bought at any of the major furniture discount markets.</li>
<li>Food: Good food is good food for a reason. I buy my stuff at the local farmer's market, where you can still see where your food came from. Carrots are not all straight and still have soil on them, tomatoes are not all standardized in one size and color, salad tends to have soil on it if you don't wash it properly, and meat and fish is not bought pre-packaged. But rest assured, you'll taste the difference. But no, I don't buy some special tv-cook-endorsed salt that costs 30$ a pack, because that is just pretentiousness.</li>
</ul>
