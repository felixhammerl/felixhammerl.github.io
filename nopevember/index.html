            <p>This is a post about being mindful when it comes to food. It is inspired by some of the recent news coverage on the topics of food. Now don't get me wrong, there's a lot of bullshit out there, for example:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyeor3z9EdQ">Lifehunters one month of not eating shitty foods</a>: Step 1: Be skinny and fit (15.5% body fat is a really good value for someone who is not an athlete). Step 2: Starve yourself and digest your own muscle mass. He lost 4.5 kg total, 1.64 kg is fat tissue, which is a 2.83 kg loss in muscle mass. In one month. Congrats idiot, you just starved away two-months-progress of intense fitness training.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/who-does-bacon-cause-cancer-sort-of-but-not-really/">WHO realized that eating bacon on a daily basis is unhealthy</a> ... by increasing the relative risk for colorectal cancer by 18 percent, raising it from 5% to 6%. If you eat bacon on a daily basis, you're gonna have some more problems than just colorectal cancer. Kudos, WHO.</p>

<h5 id="but">... but ...</h5>

<p>... still, I can't shake the feeling that there's some room for improvement in our meal plans. I am a fairly healthy individual, work out five to eight times a week (daily 5 km run, <a href="http://www.1860boxen.de/">boxing</a>, <a href="http://www.maennerschwimmverein.de/index.php/masters">swimming</a>, <a href="http://www.fit-star.de/">fitness</a>), and I eat fairly well, i.e. I like to cook and I try to avoid processed food. So here's my plan for November.</p>

<h5 id="dont">Don't:</h5>

<ul>
<li><strong>Processed Food? Nope.</strong> Absolutely no processed food or artificial ingredients: That includes sweets, chips, some fruit juices, sausages, burgers, and (much to my dismay) <a href="http://www.paulaner.de/de/produkte/alkoholfreie-getraenke/spezi">Paulaner Spezi</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Sugar? Nope.</strong> Espresso and tea tastes better without it, anyway.</li>
<li><strong>High-Sodium Foods? Nope.</strong> Common sense is that we eat too much salt, a lot of which comes from the aforementioned processed foods. Foods loaded with unnecessary amounts of sodium will cause you to retain water. You are probably carrying a lot of fluid which you were assuming to be fat. The body only needs between 2000-2500mg of sodium a day to complete its metabolic functions. In general, I'll avoid foods like smoked, cured, salted or canned meat, salted nuts, but also the pinch of salt you eat with your breakfast egg/cucumber. I will, however, still use salt when I cook a meal, albeit in greatly reduced quantity, because Bolognese sauce without salt tastes like ass.</li>
<li><strong>Alcohol? Nope.</strong> Duh.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="do">Do:</h5>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eat local</strong>: Buying local is not only a good idea in terms of ecological footprint, but also in terms of furthering local agriculture. My vegetables are mostly from the local farmer's market, so there should not be too much of a difference here.</li>
<li><strong>Flexitarian diet</strong>: Vegan is not for me, because I personally feels it is overhyped. If you can pull it off without becoming a missionary, more power to you. But still, the human body is not made for eating meat on a daily basis, so a vegetarian diet makes a lot of sense. There's just the tiny caveat that I <em>really</em> like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO-LFVHpA4s">a tasty steak</a>, fish or some Tartar every now and then. So I'll allow myself fish and meat once a week each. Flexitarian it is.</li>
<li><strong>High-protein foods</strong> and <strong>unsaturated fats</strong>: Greek Yoghurt, Cheese, Eggs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muesli">Muesli</a>, Lentils, Nuts, Tofu, Fish, Avocado, Olives, ...</li>
<li><strong>Fruit</strong>, lots of them.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="so">So ...</h5>

<p>... this will not be one of those posts where I get a check-up before doing this, then claiming that some values have improved, giving it a pseudo-science-y feel. This will just be a report of my experience along the road. Also, this post will be updated every couple of days with tasty recipes.</p>

<h6 id="updateday3">Update, Day 3</h6>

<p>The first thing I realized was the stuff i couldn't eat. Going through a supermarket is weird. Suddenly you're gonna find yourself looking at both food and drinks more closely: Is there artificial ingredients? Added sugar? Salt?</p>

<p>Example: Today, I was going to the movies. Popcorn? Nope, sugared/salted. Soft drinks? Obviously not. Then I started going through anything they offered and luckily I found exactly one thing to eat and drink, respectively: Apple Juice Spritzer and dried apple slices.</p>

<h3 id="recipes">Recipes</h3>

<p>As promised, here's a couple of recipes...</p>

<h6 id="salmonandfriedpotatoes">Salmon and Fried Potatoes</h6>

<p>Dead simple recipe, really tasty.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: 200g salmon, a handful of boiling/waxy/low-starch potato, 1 branch of rosemary, pepper, salt, olive oil</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong>:  ~ 20 minutes</p>

<p><strong>Preparation</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Peel potatoes, cut into 1cm^3 cubes.  </li>
<li>Put the potatoes into boiling, lightly salted water for 5 minutes. <em>Don't leave them in longer</em>, otherwise they'll become mushy later.  </li>
<li>Take potatoes out, dip into cold water.  </li>
<li>Put potatoes into a heated frying pan with hot olive oil. Remember that you're dealing with olive oil, so <em>don't let it smoke</em>, just hot enough to fry the potatoes. Add a pinch of salt, pepper. Pluck the rosemary "leaves" from branch, mix them in with the potatoes. Adjust temperature and frying time to your liking.  </li>
<li>Rinse the salmon with water, dry it with a kitchen paper towel. Put salmon into a heated frying pan with hot olive oil. Be really careful to not apply too much heat to the salmon. Fry gently: If the salmon is fresh, <em>don't fry it to death (!)</em>, since it tastes best when it still has a little rose color in the middle. Like many fish, fresh salmon is really tasty in raw form (e.g. sushi).  </li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
